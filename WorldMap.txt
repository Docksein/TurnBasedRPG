Ancient tomes and scrolls fill the shelves from floor to ceiling. The air smells of old parchment and leather bindings.
A reading desk sits in the center with an open book.

You have entered the lair of an ancient red dragon.
The cavern is enormous, with piles of treasure scattered about and scorch marks covering the walls.
